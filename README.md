# 🎉 3D ASCII Graphics - The Ultimate Time Waster 🎉

### Welcome, brave soul!

This project took me 3 days to finish and I call it a big waste of time. But our Linux lectures in college are an even bigger waste of time, so I chose the smallest evil.
**THIS** is the greatest engine for those who like staring at figures in a console. Remember the code that rotates a DONUT? Now this is similar but made by a Junior.

### 🌟 What Can It Do?
Sure, I could’ve stopped at printing “Hello, World!” but no, I had to go full-on ASCII graphics mode. Here’s the magic it brings to your terminal:

- **Spheres**: Perfectly round-ish in glorious ASCII.
- **Cubes**: As cubic as it gets when you only have letters.
- **Cones**: Triangles with attitude.
- **Light**: Because, hey, who doesn’t want to play with ASCII shadows?
- **Reflections**: So you can see yourself wasting even more time!
- **Perspective**: For that dramatic effect when your ASCII objects stare into your soul.

### 🚀 Running the Madness
If you're still with me, just run `display.cpp` to generate your stunning, one-of-a-kind ASCII scene.

### 🛠️ Customizing Resolution
Want your cubes a bit blockier or smoother? Go ahead and adjust the **resolution** directly in `display.cpp`. Be warned, though, the more detail, the more of your life you'll lose watching it render!

P.S

Thanks to Newton, the man, the virgin, and the legend! Without him, I would never finish this project.

Enjoy!
