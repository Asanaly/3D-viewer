- Currently working on generating mesh. Done working with basic object class and vectors class. Done with reflections.

-Stopped working on square plane for a while. Prioratize light for now.

-Added perspective

-Added sphere, and reflections. Not tested.

-Mesh generator kinda works, not sure though. Some bugs with reflection. Try checking how the normal vector.

-I think reflection now works fine

-I will add the idea of tacking average of neighboring light sources.

-We need to reflect only from the closest point that satisfy onVector.

-Reflection works good I guess

-Disabeled depths view for now

-onLight function should be in every class that inherit object

-Looking for no reflection bug

-When there are two light, works worse

-Reflection don't work when light is on the right

- there are a big mixup in point coordinates in Sphere Mesh
